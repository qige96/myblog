SLP
Similar to Problog, Stochastic Logic Programs is also a probabilistic extesion of classic logic programs. However, SLP is different from Problog, in particular the semantics. So far, the probabilistic logic we had introduced are based on possible world semantics. That is, the probability value assigned to a proposition indicates “the probability of the proposition being true”.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Probabilistic Logic: SRL - Problog</title><link>https://qige96.github.io/myblog/posts/review-prob-logic-srl-problog/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2022 22:35:02 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://qige96.github.io/myblog/posts/review-prob-logic-srl-problog/</guid><description>Problog1 is a probabilistic extension to the classical logic programming language Prolog.
A problog program is a set of probabilistic facts and a set of deterministic rules. A probabilistic fact is denoted as \(p::\phi\) where \(\phi\) is an atom and \(p\) is the probability. A rule is denoted as \(h :- b_1,...,b_k\) where the head \(h\) and body \(b_i\) are all atoms. A rule says that \(h\) is true only if all the \(b\) are true.</description></item><item><title>A Review of Probabilistic Logic: SRL - Intro</title><link>https://qige96.github.io/myblog/posts/review-prob-logic-srl-intro/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2022 22:12:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://qige96.github.io/myblog/posts/review-prob-logic-srl-intro/</guid><description>In this part, we introduce a bunch of theories combining logic and probability that emerged in the late 1990s, called Statistical Relational Learning (SRL). As the name indicates, SRL studies how to learn and exploit the statistical structure among relational data (or tabular data, a set of data in the form of a table).
Recall that the central question in probabilistic logic is \(\phi_1^{X_1},\dots,\phi_n^{X_n}|\!\!\!\approx \psi^Y\), and the key challenge is handling dependency relationships.</description></item><item><title>Explaining Probability Calibration</title><link>https://qige96.github.io/myblog/posts/explaining-probability-calibration/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jul 2022 00:27:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://qige96.github.io/myblog/posts/explaining-probability-calibration/</guid><description>This is a reading note explaining what probability calibration is, why we should use it, and how to achieve it. I will firstly introduce the origin of this notion, and then explain how to achieve probability calibration and why this can work. Lastly, I reveal the benefits of probability calibration.
Philosophical Origin What is probability calibration? In a word, calibration means the forecast probabilities match the relative frequencies: \(fr(X|pr(X)=\beta)=\beta\), where \(fr(X)\) represents the relative frequency of \(X\) and \(pr(X)\) represents the predicted probability of \(X\).</description></item><item><title>5G Network Summary</title><link>https://qige96.github.io/myblog/posts/5g-network-summary/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 16:12:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://qige96.github.io/myblog/posts/5g-network-summary/</guid><description>This note is a summary of some key points and comments to the description of 5G network architecture, which is defined by European Telecommunications Standards Institute. (ETSI).
Network Architecture: Traditional versus Cloud Native We all know that a computer network is a group of inter-connected computers, among which computers could communicate with one another.
Traditionally, we need some devices to facilitate the networking ability, typically switches and routers, which are THE two key devices for computer network to forward messages.</description></item></channel></rss>
