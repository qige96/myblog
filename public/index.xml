      <description>This is a reading note explaining what probability calibration is, why we should use it, and how to achieve it. I will firstly introduce the origin of this notion, and then explain how to achieve probability calibration and why this can work. Lastly, I reveal the benefits of probability calibration.
Philosophical Origin What is probability calibration? In a word, calibration means the forecast probabilities match the relative frequencies: $fr(X|pr(X)=\beta)=\beta$, where $fr(X)$ represents the relative frequency of $X$ and $pr(X)$ represents the predicted probability of $X$.</description>

      <description>This note is a summary of some key points and comments to the description of 5G network architecture, which is defined by European Telecommunications Standards Institute. (ETSI).
Network Architecture: Traditional versus Cloud Native We all know that a computer network is a group of inter-connected computers, among which computers could communicate with one another.
Traditionally, we need some devices to facilitate the networking ability, typically switches and routers, which are THE two key devices for computer network to forward messages.</description>
